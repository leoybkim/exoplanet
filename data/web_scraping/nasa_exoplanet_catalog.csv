Like Luke Skywalker&#39;s home planet Tatooine, Kepler-16b would have two sunsets if you could stand on its surface. This planet, however, is likely cold, about the size of Saturn and gaseous, though partly composed of rock. It lies outside its two stars&rsquo; &ldquo;habitable zone,&rdquo; where liquid water could exist. And its stars are cooler than our sun, probably rendering the planet lifeless. Of course, we could look on the bright side (so to speak). When the discovery was announced in 2011, Bill Borucki, the now-retired NASA principal investigator for Kepler at Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California, said finding the new planet might actually broaden the prospects for life in our galaxy. About half of all stars belong to binary systems, so the fact that planets form around these, as well as around single stars, can only increase the odds.</p>

Molecules of hydrogen gas are likely ripped apart on the dayside of tidally-locked KELT-9b, unable to re-form until their disjointed atoms flow around to the planet&#39;s nightside.</p>

<p>With a dayside temperature of more than 7,800 degrees Fahrenheit (4,600 Kelvin), KELT-9b is a planet that is hotter than most stars. But its star, called KELT-9, is even hotter &ndash;&nbsp;a blue A-type star that is likely unraveling the planet through evaporation.</p>

<p>KELT-9b is a gas giant 2.8 times more massive than Jupiter, but only half as dense. Scientists would expect the planet to have a smaller radius, but the extreme radiation from its host star has caused the planet&#39;s atmosphere to puff up like a balloon.</p>

<p>The planet is also unusual in that it orbits perpendicular to the spin axis of the star. That would be analogous to the planet orbiting perpendicular to the plane of our solar system. One &quot;year&quot; on this planet is less than two days long.</p>

<p>With each orbit, KELT-9 b twice experiences the full range of stellar temperatures, producing what amounts to a peculiar seasonal sequence. The planet experiences &ldquo;summer&rdquo; when it swings over each hot pole and &ldquo;winter&rdquo; when it passes over the star&rsquo;s cooler midsection. So KELT-9 b experiences two summers and two winters every orbit, with each season about nine hours.</p>

<p>The KELT-9 star is only 300 million years old, which is young in star time. It is more than twice as large, and nearly twice as hot, as our sun. Given that the planet&#39;s atmosphere is constantly blasted with high levels of ultraviolet radiation, the planet may even be shedding a tail of evaporated planetary material like a comet.</p>

Imagine if every time Earth orbited the sun once, Venus orbited the sun twice (in real life, Earth and Venus are not in resonance). This unusual phenomenon was first discovered with Jupiter&#39;s moons, and may mirror an early version of our solar system in which Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune once were in a similar configuration. Kepler-223 is the first system with four planets discovered in resonance. The two innermost planets, Kepler-223 b and c, are in 4:3 resonance, the second and third in 3:2, and the third and fourth planets are in 4:3. Each planet likely has a solid core, with an envelope of gas and a tight orbit, classifying them as &quot;sub-Neptunes.&quot; Though these worlds are much larger than Earth, they orbit nearer their star than Mercury does our sun.</p>

In July 2022 it became the first exoplanet to be studied by NASA&#39;s James Webb Space Telescope.</p>

<p>The Webb Space Telescope captured the first clear evidence for carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of a planet outside the solar system with its study of this world. This observation of a gas giant planet orbiting a Sun-like star 700 light-years away provides important insights into the composition and formation of the planet.</p>

<p>In November 2022, five science papers reported on WASP-39 b discoveries made using JWST. Those included the first observation of sulfer dioxide and photochemistry (chemical changes influenced by starlight) in an exoplanet atmosphere.</p>

<p>WASP-39 b is a hot&nbsp;giant about the same size as Saturn. Its extreme puffiness is related in part to its high temperature (about 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit or 900 degrees Celsius). Unlike the cooler, more compact gas giants in our solar system, WASP-39 b orbits very close to its star &ndash; only about one-eighth the distance between the Sun and Mercury &ndash; completing one circuit in just over four Earth-days. The planet&rsquo;s discovery was made based on ground-based detections of the subtle, periodic dimming of light from its host star as the planet transits, or passes in front of the star.</p>

<p>Previous observations from other telescopes, including NASA&rsquo;s Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes, revealed the presence of water vapor, sodium, and potassium in the planet&rsquo;s atmosphere. Webb&rsquo;s unmatched infrared sensitivity has now confirmed the presence of carbon dioxide on this planet as well.</p>

<p>Models of planetary atmospheres indicate that any world with the common mix of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen, and a temperature up to 1,000 Kelvin (1,340 degrees Fahrenheit) should have a large amount of methane and a small amount of carbon monoxide.</p>

<p>The planet&nbsp;is about 800 Kelvin (or 980 degrees Fahrenheit) &ndash; so it was expected to have methane but Spitzer&#39;s observations showed it does not.</p>

<p>The planet is&nbsp;too compact to be made mostly of hydrogen gas, like Jupiter,&nbsp;but may not be compact enough to be a rocky super-Earth. Researchers think it may be&nbsp;made mostly of an exotic form of water, an &quot;ice&quot; hardened by pressure rather than temperature.</p>

<p>Huble&#39;s Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph measured changes in the color of light from the planet before, during and after a pass behind its star. There was a small drop in light and a slight change in the color of the light. &quot;We saw the light becoming less bright in the blue but not in the green or red. Light was missing in the blue but not in the red when it was hidden,&quot; said research team member Frederic Pont of the University of Exeter in South West England. &quot;This means that the object that disappeared was blue.&quot;</p>

<p>Earlier observations have reported evidence for scattering of blue light on the planet. Hubble observations confirmsed the evidence.</p>

<p>If seen directly, this planet would look like a deep blue dot, reminiscent of Earth&#39;s color as seen from space. That is where the comparison ends.</p>

<p>On this turbulent alien world, the daytime temperature is nearly 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and it possibly rains glass &mdash; sideways &mdash; in howling, 4,500-mph winds. The cobalt blue color comes not from the reflection of a tropical ocean as it does on Earth, but rather a hazy, blow-torched atmosphere containing high clouds laced with silicate particles. Silicates condensing in the heat could form very small drops of glass that scatter blue light more than red light.</p>

<p>Hubble and other observatories have made intensive studies of HD 189733b and found its atmosphere to be changeable and exotic.</p>

The planet may have lost one atmosphere but gained another from volcanic activity.</p>

<p>GJ 1132 b, is hypothesized to have begun as a gaseous world with a thick hydrogen blanket of atmosphere. Starting out at several times the diameter of Earth, this so-called &ldquo;sub-Neptune&rdquo; is believed to have quickly lost its primordial hydrogen and helium atmosphere due to the intense radiation of the hot, young star it orbits. In a short period of time, such a planet would be stripped down to a bare core about the size of Earth. That&rsquo;s when things got interesting.</p>

<p>To the surprise of astronomers, Hubble observed an atmosphere which, according to their theory, is a &ldquo;secondary atmosphere&rdquo; that is present now. Based on a combination of direct observational evidence and inference through computer modeling, the team reports that the atmosphere consists of molecular hydrogen, hydrogen cyanide, methane and also contains an aerosol haze. Modeling suggests the aerosol haze is based on photochemically produced hydrocarbons, similar to smog on Earth.</p>

<p>Scientists interpret the current atmospheric hydrogen in GJ 1132 b as hydrogen from the original atmosphere which was absorbed into the planet&rsquo;s molten magna mantle and is now being slowly released through volcanic processes to form a new atmosphere. The atmosphere we see today is believed to be continually replenished to balance the hydrogen escaping into space.</p>

<p>The image, as seen through four different light filters, shows how Webb&rsquo;s powerful infrared gaze can easily capture worlds beyond our solar system, pointing the way to future observations that will reveal more information than ever before about exoplanets.</p>

<p>Taking direct images of exoplanets is challenging because stars are so much brighter than planets. The HIP 65426 b planet is more than 10,000 times fainter than its host star in the near-infrared, and a few thousand times fainter in the mid-infrared.</p>

<p>In each filter image, the planet appears as a slightly differently shaped blob of light. That is because of the particulars of Webb&rsquo;s optical system and how it translates light through the different optics.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Obtaining this image felt like digging for space treasure,&rdquo; said Aarynn Carter, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who led the analysis of the images. &ldquo;At first all I could see was light from the star, but with careful image processing I was able to remove that light and uncover the planet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every day is a bad day on planet TOI 849 b. About half the mass of our own Saturn, this planet orbits a Sun-like star more than 700 light-years from Earth. It hugs its star so tightly that a year &ndash; one trip around the star &ndash; takes less than a day. And it pays a high price for this close embrace: an estimated surface temperature of nearly 2,800 degrees Fahrenheit, which is 1,500 degrees Celsius. It&#39;s a scorcher even compared to Venus, which is 880 degrees Fahrenheit (471 degrees Celsius).</p>

<p>But for TOI 849 b, discovered in 2020 by NASA&#39;s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), the price of closeness to its star might have been even higher. Though about the size of Neptune, the planet appears to have little or no atmosphere. Scientists aren&#39;t sure why, but the possibilities include photoevaporation &ndash; the stripping away of a planet&#39;s atmosphere by intense radiation from its star.</p>

<p>Compared to other exoplanets that orbit very close to their stars, this planet is quite unusual because it is 40 times the mass of Earth but only about three times as big around. The gravity of such massive worlds should attract large amounts of gas from the disk of material out of which planets form. And planets with similarly large masses are five to 10 times as wide as Earth. But TOI 849 b is a lot less puffy than that, leading scientists to conclude that it lacks a substantial atmosphere.</p>

That means this system put on quite a show for astronomers: They observed the two stars make a total of three eclipses, while the planet traced its way across one star and then, a few days later, across the other.</p>

<p>Worlds that orbit two stars are known as &ldquo;circumbinary&rdquo; planets because they or&shy;bit &ldquo;binary&rdquo; stars, or stars in orbit around each other. Finding transiting circumbinaries is quite rare; TESS&rsquo;s predecessor, the now retired Kepler Space Telescope, yielded discoveries of thousands of exoplanets, but only around a dozen circumbinary planets. The exoplanet TIC 172900988 b is a gas giant the size of our own Jupiter, though far more massive. It orbits two Sun-like stars that, in turn, orbit each other.</p>

<p>High-resolution imaging in the near-infrared part of the light spectrum revealed what might be a third star in this system. The star would have a very long orbit &ndash; about 5,000 years &ndash; encircling both stars and the newly discovered planet. This ultra-cool star has a low mass (or heft), less than 10 percent of the other two stars and only 30 times more massive than the giant planet.</p>

<p>Red dwarf stars are the smallest and dimmest members of so-called main-sequence stars &mdash; stars that convert hydrogen into helium in their cores at a steady rate. Though &ldquo;cool&rdquo; compared to stars like our Sun, red dwarf stars can be extremely active and erupt with powerful flares capable of stripping a planet of its atmosphere, making this star system a seemingly inhospitable location to form such a gossamer planet.</p>

<p>The six known planets orbiting a star very like the Sun are locked in orbital resonance, making for a well-timed planetary dance. The period ratios are near 3:2, 2:1, 3:2, 7:5, and 3:2, meaning that for every three orbits of the first planet, b, the second planet orbits twice, and so on.</p>
