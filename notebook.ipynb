    "# What is an exoplanet?\n",
    "\n",
    "An exoplanet is a planet located outside of our solar system. While most orbit around other stars, some exoplanets freely float around the galaxy instead, known as rogue planets. For every star you see in the night sky, on average, has at least one planet. Majority of exoplanets found to date are located in the Milky Way which is only a small sample of the galaxy. In a decade, the number of exoplanets discovered could potentially increase to tens of thousands as more robotic telescopes are launched into space with better observing capabilities.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Transit\n",
    "- Searching for shadows\n",
    "- When planet passes directly between its star and an observer, it dims the star's light by a measureable amount\n",
    "- 3978 planets discovered (74.9%)\n",
    "#### Radial Velocity\n",
    "- Watching for wobble\n",
    "- Orbiting planets cause stars to wobble in space, changing the color of the light astronomers observe\n",
    "- 1030 planets discovered (19.4%)\n",
    "#### Gravitational Microlensing\n",
    "- Light in a gravity lens\n",
    "- Light from distant star is bent and focused by gravity as a planet passes between the star and Earth\n",
    "- 177 planets discovered (3.3%)\n",
    "#### Direct Imaging\n",
    "- Taking pictures\n",
    "- Astronomers can take pictures of exoplanets by removing the overwhelming glare of the stars they orbit\n",
    "- 64 planets discovered (1.2%)\n",
    "#### Transit Timing Variations\n",
    "- 25 planets discovered (0.47%)\n",
    "#### Eclipse Timing Variations\n",
    "- 17 planets discovered (0.32%)\n",
    "#### Orbital Brightness Modulation\n",
    "- 9 planets discovered (0.17%)\n",
    "#### Pulsar Timing\n",
    "- 7 planets discovered (0.13%)\n",
    "#### Astrometry\n",
    "- Minuscule movements\n",
    "- The orbit of a planet can cause a star to wobble around in space in relation to nearby stars in the sky\n",
    "- 2 planets discovered (0.04%)\n",
    "#### Pulsation Timing Variations\n",
    "- 2 planets discovered (0.04%)\n",
    "#### Disk Kinematics\n",
    "- 1 planet discovered (0.02%)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exoplanet naming convention\n",
    "\n",
    "Only few exoplanets have \"proper names\" but all have designations.\n",
    "First part of the designation is usually the telescope or survey that discovered it.\n",
    "Followed by the number in which the star was cataloged by position.\n",
    "Lastly, the lowercase letter stands for the planet, in the order in which the planet was found - first one being 'b' ('A' is reserved for the star). If bunch of exoplanets around the same star are found at once, the planet closest to its star is named 'b' with more distant ones named 'c', 'd', 'e' and so on.\n",

    "# Planet types\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gas giant\n",
    "- a giant planet composed mainly of gas (helium and or hydrogen)\n",
    "- 1672 planets discovered\n",
    "- \"hot Jupiters\", gas giants nearer to their stars make such tight orbits that they cause a pronounced wobble in their stars, making it easier to detect using the radial velocity method.\n",
    "#### Neptunian\n",
    "- similar in size to Neptune or Uranus that typically have hydrogen and helium-dominated atmospheres with cores of rock and heavier metals.\n",
    "- 1835 planets discovered\n",
    "#### Super-Earth\n",
    "- more massive than Earth yet lighter than ice giants like Neptune and Uranus, and can be made of gas, rock or a combination of both\n",
    "- 1605 planets discovered\n",
    "#### Terrestrial\n",
    "- Earth sized and smaller composed of rock, silicate, water or carbon\n",
    "- 195 planets discovered\n",
    "#### Unknown\n",
    "- 5 planets discovered"
